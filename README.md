# CI-in-Java
Xray, Java, IntelliJ, Jenkins, Maven

Below explains what I did in sequence

Set up my own Jira instance in https://helennz.atlassian.net/jira/your-work
And then add Xray as test management.
Create Epic, Story, Test Cases, Test Plan, Test Execution.

Open Test Execution in Xray and explort it.
Then automate it in Jira.
Run it successfully
Import test result successfully.

Install Jenkins locally and install suggested plugins
Install Maven and Xray plugins and configure them.
And then run from Jenkins will update the result in Jira-Xray.
